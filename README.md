# MinMax and Alpha-Beta Prunning agents for Halma Game

This is a project for implementing the Halma game in Python.

## Description

Halma is a strategic board game designed for two players. The objective of the game is to move all your pieces from your starting position to the opposite corner of the board before your opponent accomplishes the same. This implementation allows games between two agents that can utilize three different heuristics and two algorithms (Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning). Programm uses C++ module to generate possible moves using Depth First Search 


## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd halma-game`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create venv and then build c++ library as a module using python c_utils\setup.py build install
